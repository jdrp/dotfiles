    "# BUILDING A RELATIVE VALUATION ALGORITHM\n",
    "In this project, we will guide you on how to use Python to create a proper algorithm that outputs crucial information for the relative valuation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you know, Relative Valuation (or Valuation via Multiples) is extremely useful for its simplicity, although this can also entail some problems. The underlying idea for this valuation is that similar firms should be trading (priced) at similar prices with respect to their multiples (e.g., PE, EV/EBITDA, EV/Sales, …)\n",

    "Even though it is relatively easy to perform these calculations, provided that you have access to the data, we will create an algorithm to facilitate the task."
