hello today we're going to begin talking about a business strategy with specific emphasis on the resource-based view which is also referred to as rbv in this lesson we're gonna look again at the question of what leads to differential firm performance why does one firm outperform its competitors what makes your company more successful than mine although there are a number of schools of thought regarding differential firm performance there are two that I think are most relevant for supply chain thought there's the resource-based view and the positioning approach in this lesson we're gonna focus on the resource-based view RB V was developed by a number of scholars like Barney Petr and Werner Felton over time it has continued to evolve and adapt to the ever-changing corporate landscape originally RB V was based on a few core concepts RB V has an internal firm focus and advocates that competitive advantage is derived from exploiting internal firm resources and capabilities rather than external factors resource based logic suggests that firms rely on both tangible and intangible resources that are assumed to be heterogeneous and immobile firm resources must also have certain attributes in order to help provide competitive advantage those attributes are valuable rare inimitable and non substitutable let's look at each aspect of the RB V conceptual model in a little more detail resource base logics suggest that firms rely on both tangible and intangible resources that are assumed to be heterogeneous and a mobile firm resources must also have certain attributes in order to help provide a competitive advantage those attributes are valuable rare inimitable and non substitutable let's look at each aspect of the RB V conceptual model in a little more detail resources can be tangible or intangible although we all probably have an intuitive sense of what that means let's more specifically define these terms give some examples and talk about why they are each important tangible resources refer to physical things that we can see in touch like land buildings equipment and capital in a supply chain context tangible resources might include a network of distribution centers or a fleet of trucks these types of resources can provide an advantage but that advantage is often short term because tangible resources can often be purchased in an open market on the other hand intangible resources have no physical presence we cannot see or touch intangible resources these are things like skills capabilities know-how or process expertise intangible resources take time to develop and they cannot be easily purchased on the open market let me contrast tangible and intangible resources with a supply chain example any firm can purchase distribution centers or a fleet of trucks all it takes is cash to buy those tangible resources however the know how to leverage distribution and transportation capabilities in the most efficient and effective manner is an intangible resource that takes time to develop that type of intellectual expertise is the main source of competitive advantage the resource base view is also based on two key assumptions they are heterogeneity and in mobility the assumption that resources are heterogeneous means that resources differ from company to company and that firms in the exact same industry with the exact same external forces can still have different internal resources that lead to differential firm performance for example Apple and Samsung both compete in the tablet and smartphone markets and they share the same industry structure however the companies have heterogeneous internal resources that can explain their performance differentials the assumption that resources are immobile simply means that resources cannot easily move from one company to another in the short in mobility also means that competitors cannot quickly replicate their rivals resources or their strategies for example many companies would like to have apples innovation capabilities but that strategic resource takes a lot of time and money to develop and it cannot be quickly duplicated it is a mobile according to our BV resources must also have very specific characteristics in order to create a competitive advantage the acronym veeram helps me remember that resources must be valuable rare inimitable and non substitutable quite simply resources are valuable if they help a company reduce costs increase differentiation or combine cost and differentiation characteristics in a way that creates value for customers in a supply chain context any strategic resources that help provide time place form or possession utility and a better cheaper or faster way are valuable resources also need to be rare and by that I mean resources cannot be widely available to competitors because if everyone has a resource then it is impossible for it to drive differential firm performance and competitive advantage in our BV language resources must be in imitable that is they must be difficult or costly to imitate so competitors cannot easily copy and implement your strategic approach typically supply chain processes with a lot of different steps across functional and organizational boundaries are some of the most difficult intangible resources to imitate because every step in the process is unknown to competitors or it's unclear which steps are most important either way supply chain know-how is tough to imitate finally in addition to being valuable rare and inimitable resources also need to be non substitutable that means they cannot be replaced by other readily available resources or a minimum it must be costly for a rival to find a substitutable resource the reason that resources need to be valuable rare in imitable and non substitutable is so that they can be used towards competitive advantage competitive advantage occurs when companies implement a value creating strategy the competitors are not using this can provide superior performance relative to other competitors in the exact same industry that is the essence of competitive advantage and the goal of our BV logic but what is this high-level strategic management concept have to be with supply chain management that's a fair question to ask quite simply in my opinion supply chain management is the ultimate source of competitive advantage because it fits so well within the rbv framework if you think about it structurally supply chains have existed for centuries we have always sourced raw materials operationally transform them into finished goods and logistically move them to where they were needed when they were needed we've always depended on getting the right products to the right place at the right time however it has just been over the past few decades that we began to think about supply chain management in an integrated and holistic manner we are still discovering all the benefits of communicating collaborating and coordinating about basic business processes across functional corporate and national boundaries this intricate and nuanced know-how is definitely an intangible resource that is valuable it is rare it is inimitable and it is non substitutable supply chain management expertise is not prevalent and you cannot just move it from one company to another and yet if you do eventually crack the code and manage supply chains well companies can provide their customers with a much more valuable bundle of cost service and timeliness attributes the capability to efficiently and effectively manage supply chains is a strategic resource that drives differential firm performance so what leads to differential firm performance it's the capability to efficiently and effectively manage supply chains as a strategic resource that drives the differences we see in the market
